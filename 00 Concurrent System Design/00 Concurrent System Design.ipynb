    "Ray tracing is a technique to render raster images of a three-dimensional scene, e.g. in animations. For all pixels of the image, rays are traced \"backwards\" from the camera (eye) until they hit an object of the scene. From there, the reflecting and refracting rays are traced until they hit a light source. This process is recursively repeated as objects may be in the shadow of other objects. The color and intensity of a pixel is then calculated based on the reflecting and refracting properties of the traced objects and the color of the light source. The run-time for each pixel is proportional to the number of light sources, proportional to the number of rays spawned by every object hit, and exponential in the depth of the recursion.\n",
    "\n",
    "As light rays do not influence each other, all pixels of a frame and all frames of an animation can be computed in parallel. With 4K resolution (3840 × 2160 pixels) and 24 frames per second, a 110 min animation needs 1.3 × 10¹² pixels computed. For all rays needed for one pixel, the intersection of the ray with any object needs to be determined."

    "- Around 2000, Windows shipped with 500 device drivers, most of them provided by device vendors. Reportedly, 80% of Windows crashes were traced back to faulty device drivers; concurrency errors (incorrect locking and releasing of resources etc.) were the most frequent.\n",
