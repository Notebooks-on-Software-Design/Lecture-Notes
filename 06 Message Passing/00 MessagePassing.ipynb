    "So far, we have assumed that processes share memory: they may have their own local variables, but they communicate through global variables, including those protected by monitors. In _message passing,_ processes communicate by _sending and receiving messages_ over _channels_. Shared memory is not needed. As all variables are local to a process, mutual exclusion is guaranteed.\n",

Hence process `ticker` above cannot be used reliably for a clock. For this, the time between calls to `Sleep` has to be measured and sleeping reduced by that amount. The `time` library provides [`Ticker`](https://golang.org/pkg/time/#Ticker) objects that implement that. Tickers are created with `NewTicker(duration)` and have a field `C` with a channel that continuously ticks by sending the time of the tick:"
